# Products Mobile Application

## Approach
- Used MVVM architecture with Jetpack Compose
- Implemented pagination for product listing
- Created interactive image gallery for product details
- Used Retrofit for network operations

## Trade-offs
- Offline caching not implemented due to time constraints
- Chose simplicity over complex state management
- Used Coil for image loading instead of Glide

## Features
- Product listing with pagination
- Product details with image gallery
- Error handling
- Splash screen
